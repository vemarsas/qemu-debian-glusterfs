Forked from git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-qemu/qemu.git, 
branch: debian-unstable, in order to natively integrate GlusterFS 
distributed storage.

APT-pinning is being used to prevent these packages from being oerwritten
by non-gluster debs during an apt-get upgrade. 

To do so, an /etc/apt/preferences.d/qemu-glusterfs.pref file is 
installed.
